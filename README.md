## ❖ Problem Statement

Many students and job seekers face difficulties in preparing professional resumes due to a lack of knowledge about proper formatting and content. Existing resume builders are often paid, time-consuming, or lack interactivity. This project provides a simple, fast, and free solution.

## ❖ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites

* **Python (3.8+):** Ensure Python is installed.
* **Oracle Database (e.g., 21c XE):** Download and install an Oracle Database instance.
* **Oracle Instant Client:** Download the Basic Package for your system and ensure the installation path is added to your system's **PATH** environment variable.

### 2. Clone the Repository

If your project is hosted on GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://your-repo-url.git
cd resume-chatbot
```

Otherwise, simply open your existing project folder.

### 3. Set Up Python Environment

Create, activate, and install dependencies into a virtual environment.
```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (Choose one based on your OS)
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install all required packages from the requirements.txt file
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

💡 **Tip:** To create a `requirements.txt` file automatically from your environment:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### 4. Database Setup (Oracle)

You must create a dedicated user and the required table for the application.

Connect to your Oracle Database (e.g., XEPDB1) as a user with admin privileges (like SYSTEM or PDBADMIN) and run the following SQL commands:

#### A. Create the Application User:
```sql
ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER = XEPDB1;

CREATE USER resume_app IDENTIFIED BY YourStrongPassword;
GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO resume_app;
GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO resume_app;
```

#### B. Create the resumes Table:

Run this under the newly created `resume_app` user:
```sql
CREATE TABLE resumes (
    -- Primary Key: auto-generated ID
    resume_id        NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    
    -- Connection and Personal Info
    session_id       VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL,
    full_name        VARCHAR2(255),
    email            VARCHAR2(255),
    phone_number     VARCHAR2(50),
    linkedin_profile VARCHAR2(500),
    
    -- Content fields (stored as CLOB to handle large text/JSON data)
    summary          CLOB,
    education        CLOB,   -- Stores JSON string of education entries
    experience       CLOB,   -- Stores JSON string of experience entries
    skills           CLOB,   -- Stores JSON string of skills list
    
    -- Metadata
    created_at       TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 5. Configure the Application

Open `app.py` and update the Oracle Database connection details with the user and password you just created:
```python
# --- Oracle Database Connection ---
# !! Update with your Oracle DB credentials !!
ORACLE_USER = "resume_app"
ORACLE_PASSWORD = "YourStrongPassword"  # <-- Update this
# DSN (Data Source Name) format: "hostname:port/service_name"
ORACLE_DSN = "localhost:1521/XEPDB1"
```

## ❖ How to Run

1. Ensure your Oracle Database is running.

2. Activate your Python virtual environment (if not already active).

3. Start the Flask server from the `resume-chatbot` directory:
```bash
python app.py
```

4. Then open your browser and navigate to:

👉 **http://127.0.0.1:5000**

You can now interact with the chatbot to build your resume!
