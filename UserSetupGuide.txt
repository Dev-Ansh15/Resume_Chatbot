ðŸš€ User Setup Guide: Chatbot Resume Builder
This guide will walk you through setting up the Chatbot Resume Builder project from scratch on a new machine. It covers the environment, database, and application configuration.

## Step 1: Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following software installed:

* Python (3.8+): The programming language for the backend.
* Oracle Database (21c XE): The free Express Edition is perfect for this. Make sure it's installed and running.
* Oracle Instant Client: The Python oracledb library requires this.
    * Download the "Basic" or "Basic Light" package for your OS.
    * Unzip it to a stable directory (e.g., C:\oracle\instantclient_21_13).
    * Crucial: Add this directory to your system's PATH environment variable.
* Visual Studio Code: Your code editor.

## Step 2: Project & Python Environment Setup
1.  Get the Project:
    * Place your project files (app.py, templates/index.html, etc.) into a new folder (e.g., resume-chatbot).
2.  Create requirements.txt:
    * It's a best practice to have a requirements.txt file. If you don't have one, open your terminal in the project folder and run:
        
        pip freeze > requirements.txt

    * (If you are on a new machine, just create requirements.txt and paste this in):
        
        Flask
        oracledb
        python-docx
        reportlab

3.  Open in VS Code:
    * Open your resume-chatbot folder in VS Code.
4.  Set Up Virtual Environment:
    * Open a new terminal in VS Code (Terminal > New Terminal).
    * Create a virtual environment:
        
        python -m venv venv
    
    * Activate it:
        
        # On Windows
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        
        # On macOS/Linux
        source venv/bin/activate
    
    * Your terminal prompt should now start with (venv).
5.  Install Dependencies:
    * Install all the required Python libraries:
        
        pip install -r requirements.txt

## Step 3: Database Configuration (in VS Code)
We will use the Oracle SQL Developer extension to set up your database without leaving VS Code.

1.  Install the Extension:
    * Go to the Extensions tab in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+X).
    * Search for "Oracle SQL Developer" (published by Oracle).
    * Click Install.
2.  Create Admin Connection (SYSTEM):
    * Click the new Oracle icon in the Activity Bar (left-hand side).
    * In the "Oracle" panel, click the + (New Connection) icon.
    * Fill out the connection details to connect as an admin (to create your app's user):
        * Connection Name: Admin (SYSTEM@XEPDB1)
        * Connection Type: Basic
        * Role: SYSDBA
        * Authentication Type: Database
        * Username: SYSTEM
        * Password: The password you set when you installed Oracle XE.
        * Hostname: localhost
        * Port: 1521
        * Service Name: XEPDB1 (This is the default Pluggable Database for XE).
    * Click Create Connection.
3.  Create the Application User:
    * Right-click your new Admin (SYSTEM@XEPDB1) connection and select Open New SQL File.
    * Paste the following SQL code into the file.
    * Change YourStrongPassword to a secure password you will remember.
        
        -- This first line is CRITICAL. It ensures you are operating inside the Pluggable Database.
        ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER = XEPDB1;
        
        -- Create the new user (schema) for your application
        CREATE USER resume_app IDENTIFIED BY YourStrongPassword;
        
        -- Grant the necessary permissions for the app user
        GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO resume_app;
        GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO resume_app;
    
    * Click the "Run Script" button (green play icon) in the top-right of the editor toolbar. You should see "User RESUME_APP created" in the output.
4.  Create Application User Connection:
    * Click the + (New Connection) icon in the Oracle panel again.
    * Fill in the details for the new user you just created:
        * Connection Name: resume_app@XEPDB1
        * Connection Type: Basic
        * Role: default
        * Username: resume_app
        * Password: YourStrongPassword (the one you just set).
        * Hostname: localhost
        * Port: 1521
        * Service Name: XEPDB1
    * Click Create Connection.
5.  Create the resumes Table:
    * Right-click your new resume_app@XEPDB1 connection and select Open New SQL File.
    * Paste the following CREATE TABLE script:
        
        CREATE TABLE resumes (
            resume_id        NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
            session_id       VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL,
            full_name        VARCHAR2(255),
            email            VARCHAR2(255),
            phone_number     VARCHAR2(50),
            linkedin_profile VARCHAR2(500),
            summary          CLOB,
            education        CLOB,
            experience       CLOB,
            skills           CLOB,
            created_at       TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
            PRIMARY KEY (resume_id)
        );
    
    * Click the "Run Script" button (green play icon). You should see "Table RESUMES created."
    * Verify: In the Oracle panel, expand resume_app@XEPDB1 -> Tables. You should now see the RESUMES table.

## Step 4: Configure the Application (app.py)
1.  In the VS Code File Explorer, open your app.py file.
2.  Scroll down to the Oracle Database Connection section (around line 18).
3.  Update the credentials to match the user you created in Step 3:
    
    # --- Oracle Database Connection ---
    # !! Update with your Oracle DB credentials !!
    ORACLE_USER = "resume_app"
    ORACLE_PASSWORD = "YourStrongPassword"  # <-- Use the password you set in Step 3!
    # DSN (Data Source Name) format: "hostname:port/service_name"
    # For Oracle XE, the service_name is often the PDB name, e.g., "XEPDB1"
    ORACLE_DSN = "localhost:1521/XEPDB1"

4.  Save the file.

## Step 5: Run the Project
You are all set!

1.  Make sure your (venv) environment is still active in your VS Code terminal.
2.  Run the Flask application:
    
    python app.py
    
3.  You should see output indicating the server is running:
    
    Oracle DB connection pool started.
     * Serving Flask app 'app'
     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
    
4.  Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

The chatbot will load, and you can now create your resume. The data will be saved in your Oracle database.
